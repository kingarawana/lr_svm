# lr_svm

This project was created for internal coding sessions during our edmunds lunch meeting. This project specifically covers linear regression with an SVM loss function.

The goal is for the participants to implement the code to calculate the loss and gradients. The participants are then to implement a vectorized version.

### Installation
1. Download and install [Anaconda][conda]
2. Run the following commands:
    ```sh
    
    conda create --name edmunds-learning python=2.7
    source activate edmunds-learning
    conda install jupyter
    ```
3. cd into project directory, then run:
    ```sh
    
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```

### Starting Workspace
1. ```cd``` to project directory (if not already there)
2. If not already in ```edmunds-learning``` python environment, start it now with ```source activate edmunds-learning```
3. run ```jupyter notebook```
